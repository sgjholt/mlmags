About
=====
This library is a collection of test projects to explore different machine learning methods for predicting moment magnitude ($M_w$) for earthquakes in Utah. 
The proposed models will be under the category of supervised learning (for now). The moment magnitude data are computed via a combination of the methods of [Holt (2019)](https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3064483/1/200880943_Sep2019.pdf) and [Holt *et al.* (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1785/0220200320)
